# UltimateWeb

Dead simple replacements for ginormous frameworks.

## Core concept

The web is a flawed environment for UI development. **However**, it is not the
worst thing ever concieved for UI development, and it has improved over the
last 30+ years. Most ginormous frameworks offer only small improvements on the
vanilla web, yet come with performance costs, and become yet another thing to
learn. Meaning, most of the development speed up is also never realized.

Before discounting the web as it is, try the [7GUIs](https://github.com/7guis/7guis)
with just HTML, CSS, and JS. I did [here](https://github.com/marshallworks/7GUIs).
You may just find that it's not great, but no worse than any other framework
for the web.

## Non-Goals

These are *NOT* meant to be complete replacements for the existing JavaScript
frameworks. Do not expect to be able to drop these into an existing project
and magically unlock *HUGE* performance enhancing gains.

Knowing about these, and especially knowing how to implement these for yourself
will *NOT* make you popular, or be a gold star on your resume. No one will hire
you for "vanilla" JavaScript skills, or pay you fat stacks of crypto.

AI will *NOT* type this code for you, for it is beneath GitHub Copilot to work
this primitively.

## Goal

These are learning tools, to show how much of the Developer Experience promised
by the big frameworks can easily be achieved with the vanilla web.

## Prerequisites

To use these "frameworks", you should be familiar with:

  * [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
  * [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)
  * [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps)

And, yes, I copied those directly from the *competitors* documentation, because it's the same.

However, you won't need any:

  * Build tools
  * Node.js
  * npm
  * etc.

Enjoy not having to learn any of that non-sense.

Just any old web-server will do, it's just HTML, CSS, and JS files ready to do
_real work_.

## WIP

Maybe if I get bored I'll add some JSDoc type information, so that
TypeScript LSP can help me feel wicked smart.

Inevitably people will point out that none of the examples are a "real" app,
even though they suffice to convince people to use the *competitors*. This
means I may come and add more examples whenever someone points out I've clearly
missed the point of [_insert their favorite framework here_].
