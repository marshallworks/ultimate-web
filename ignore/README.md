# Ignore JS

A modern React replacement.

## Features

### Template syntax

Convenient way to declare HTML structure in JavaScript, without requiring a
pre-processor or build step. Resulting HTMLElements are easily accessible to
add any additional customization.

### Components

Simple closure based components.

# WIP

* JSDoc style typings.
* Add more DOM elements.
* More examples.
